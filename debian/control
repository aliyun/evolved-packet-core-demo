Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC (Shared Files)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This package contains some core libraries/plugins required by the other
 binary packages such as vepc-{mme,sgw,pgw,pcrf,hss}.

Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC MME (Mobility Management Entity)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This package provides the MME (Mobility Management Engine), which
 terminates the S1 interfaces from the eNodeBs cells in the cellular
 network, and interfaces via S11 to the SGW as well as via S6a to the
 HSS.

Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC SGW (Serving Gateway)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This package provides the SGW (Serving Gateway) which is situated
 between the MME and PGW.  It implements the S11 interface to the MME,
 and the S5 interface to the PGW.

Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC PGW (Packet Data Network Gateway)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This package provides the PGW or PDN-GW (Packet Data Network Gateway)
 element of the EPC, i.e. the gateway between the EPC and the external
 packet data network, such as the public Internet.  It implements the S5
 interface towards the S-GW, the SGi interface towards the Internet,
 and the S7 interface towards the PCRF.

Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This package contains the PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function),
 which controls the service quality (QoS) of individual connections and
 how to account/charge related traffic.  It implements the Gx interface
 towards the PGW using the DIAMETER protocol.

Package: vepc-hss

Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends},
         mongodb,

Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC HSS (Home Subscriber Server)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This package provides the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) element of the
 EPC, i.e. the central database of mobile network subscribers, with
 their IMSI, MSISDN, cryptographic key materials, service subscription
 information, etc.  It implements the S6a interface towards the MME
 using the DIAMETER protocol.

Description: Open Source based 3GPP EPC (metapackage)
 VEPC is a C-language Open Source implementation of the 3GPP Evolved
 Packet Core, i.e. the core network of an LTE network.
 .
 This is a metapackage that depends on all the vepc parts.
